- add a flag to Key to execute the command on release (needed for commands
		affecting the keyboard grab, see scrot -s for example)
- add updategeom() hook for external tools like dzen
- consider onscreenkeyboard hooks for tablet deployment

**ToDo:**
* Resize tiled clients by dragging window borders?
cairo clips on different bar parts to not redraw everything
transparency from config.h
change the way colors are setup to allow easy gradients n stuff
on a two monitor setup, the bars are on the wrong screen
