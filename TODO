- add a flag to Key to execute the command on release (needed for commands
		affecting the keyboard grab, see scrot -s for example)
- add updategeom() hook for external tools like dzen
- consider onscreenkeyboard hooks for tablet deployment

**ToDo:**
* Implement Cairo w/ Pango?
* Wildcard skype webcams
* Fix clock?
* Resize tiled clients by dragging window borders?
* Try adapt the way multimonitor is treated: make it like GNOME Shell - basically make the extra monitor one single tag on its own.

**Issues:**
* singular borders
    * on multimonitor, you see monitor one's borders on monitor two and vice-versa.
    * in gridlayout, we can't hide either the left or the right screen edge's border off-screen.
